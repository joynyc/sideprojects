# sideprojects
I'm new to all of this and this is my journey (in the beginning at least) :)

I used postgres if anyone was wondering. Please feel free to use what I did to connect the databases and run SQL query on Jupyter. I also show how I used pandas to make a table in SQL, so I didn't need to manually write over 100 columns on postgres.
